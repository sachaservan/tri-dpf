# Ternary-tree DPF Implementation

A pure C implementation of Distributed Point Functions (DPFs) with several performance optimizations.

## üöß WORK IN PROGRSS

### TODOs
- [ ] reduce key size by dropping one correction word

Optimizations include:
- Ternary instead of a binary tree (increases communication slightly but improves evaluation performance)
- Using batched AES for fast PRF evaluation with AES-NI
- Full domain evaluation optimization of [Boyle et al.](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/707)
- The half-tree optimization of [Guo et al.](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1431.pdf)

## Dependencies

- OpenSSL 1.1.1f
- GNU Make
- Cmake
- Clang

## Getting everything to run (tested on Ubuntu, CentOS, and MacOS)

| Install dependencies (Ubuntu):         | Install dependencies (CentOS):              |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `sudo apt-get install build-essential` | `sudo yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'` |
| `sudo apt-get install cmake`           | `sudo yum install cmake`                    |
| `sudo apt install libssl-dev`          | `sudo yum install openssl-devel`            |
| `sudo apt install clang`               | `sudo yum install clang`                    |

### Running tests and benchmarks

```
cd src && make && ./test
```

#### Performance on M1 Macbook Pro

Domain of size $3^{14} \approx 2^{22}$.
